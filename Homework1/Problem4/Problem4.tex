	Consider the next combinatorial classes:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 
			$\c{B} = $ binary trees. Where size means number of nodes.
		\item 
			$\c{N} = $ binary collars. Where size means number of beads.
		\item 
			$\c{T} = $ triangulations of non-degenerated polygons. Where size means number of triangles.
		\item 
			$\c{G} = $ planar rooted trees. Where size means number of nodes.
	\end{itemize}
		
		Determine which of them are isomorphic. In such cases, construct an isomorphism.
