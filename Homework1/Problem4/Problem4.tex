	Consider the next combinatorial classes:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 
			$\c{B} = $ binary trees. Where size means number of nodes.
		\item 
			$\c{N} = $ binary collars. Where size means number of beads.
		\item 
			$\c{T} = $ triangulations of non-degenerated polygons. Where size means number of triangles.
		\item 
			$\c{G} = $ planar rooted trees. Where size means number of nodes.
	\end{itemize}
		
		Determine which of them are isomorphic. In such cases, construct an isomorphism.

\begin{proof}
	Lets contruct the functional equations for each of these cases. That way we will be able to determine if the could be
	isomorphic or not.
	
	For the first one, we have that a binary tree is either a single node, or a node with two binary sub-trees. That is
	\begin{align}
			\c{B}	&=	\c{Z} + \c{B} \times \c{Z} \times \c{B}.
	\end{align}
	
	Which give us
	\begin{align}
			B(z) = z + B^2(z) z.
	\end{align}
	
	That means
	\begin{align}
			B^2(z) z - B(z) + z = 0. 
	\end{align}
	
	This quadratic equation will have the next solution for $B(z)$:
	\begin{align}
			\frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4 z^2}}{2z} = z \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4 z^2}}{2z^2}.
	\end{align}
	
	Given that we do not have $0$ sized binary trees and what we know from [\ref{problem2}], we have that the sign is negative and this equation can be written as
	\begin{align}
			B(z) 	&= z \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n+1}\binom{2n}{n}z^{2n}	\\
						&= \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n+1}\binom{2n}{n}z^{2n + 1}
	\end{align}
	
	For the second one, 
\end{proof}
